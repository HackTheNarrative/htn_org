That growth hit a significant milestone this month when <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">W3Techs reported that WordPress now powers over 30% of sites on the web.</a></p>\n\n<p>The percentage is determined based on W3Techs’ review of the top 10 million sites on the web, and it’s a strong indicator of the popularity and flexibility of WordPress as a platform.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to have hand in helping to grow WordPress even further, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">you can get involved today</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Jargon Glossary Goes Live</h2>\n\n<p>The WordPress Marketing Team has been hard at work lately putting together <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2018/02/28/wordpress-jargon-glossary/\">a comprehensive glossary of WordPress jargon</a> to help newcomers to the project become more easily acquainted with things.</p>\n\n<p>The glossary <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2018/02/28/wordpress-jargon-glossary/\">is available here</a> along with a downloadable PDF to make it simpler to reference offline.</p>\n\n<p>Publishing this resource is part of an overall effort to make WordPress more easily accessible for people who are not so familiar with the project.

To remedy this issue, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/\">version 4.9.4 was released</a> the following day requiring many people to manually update their sites.</p>\n\n<p>While this kind of issue is always regrettable, the good thing is that it was fixed quickly, and that not all sites had updated to 4.9.3 yet, which meant they bypassed the bug in that version.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more technical information about this issue <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/\">on the Core development blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator is Back</h2>\n\n<p>In 2016, the Global Community Team ran an experimental program to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event. This program was dubbed the WordCamp Incubator, and it was so successful in the three cities where it ran that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/\">the program is back for 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Community Team is looking for cities to be a part of this year’s incubator by <a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application\">taking applications</a>. Additionally, each incubator community will need an experienced WordCamp organizer to assist them as a co-lead organizer for their event — if that sounds interesting to you, then you can <a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-co-lead-application\">fill in the application form for co-leads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out further information about the WordCamp Incubator <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/19/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-announcement/\">on the Community Team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Meetup Roundtables scheduled for March</h2>\n\n<p>In order to assist local WordPress meetup organizers with running their meetup groups, some members of the Community Team have organized <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/23/wordpress-meetup-roundtables-scheduled-for-march/\">weekly meetup roundtable discussions through the month of March</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These will be run as video chats at 16:00 UTC every Wednesday this month and will be a great place for meetup organizers to come together and help each other out with practical ideas and advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not already in the WordPress meetup program and would like to join, you can find out more information in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the WordPress Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core</h2>\n\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an upcoming regulation that will affect all online services across Europe. In order to prepare for this, a working group has been formed to make sure that WordPress is compliant with the GDPR regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that this will be a requirement for the project going forward, it will also have an important and significant impact on the privacy and security of WordPress as a whole. The working group has posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/\">their proposed roadmap</a> for this project and it looks very promising.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>WPShout published <a href=\"https://wpshout.com/complete-guide-wordpress-security/\">a thorough guide to WordPress security</a>.</li>\n    <li>The Community Team has published interesting statistics from the WordCamp program in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/27/wordcamps-in-2016/\">2016</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/28/wordcamps-in-2017/\">2017</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/15/potential-addition-of-a-new-onboarding-team/\">An intriguing proposal has been made</a> for a new ‘Onboarding’ team to be started in the WordPress project.</li>\n    <li>The new editing experience for WordPress, named Gutenberg, continues to be actively developed with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16th-february/\">a feature-packed release</a> this past month.</li>\n    <li>The Advanced WordPress Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vS_jR5-nIo\">held an interview with WordPress co-founder, Matt Mullenweg</a> about the Gutenberg project.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2018/02/27/two-factor-authentication-on-wp-org/\">Two factor authentication is on its way to the WordPress.org network</a> — this will be a great improvement to the overall security of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"5613\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"WordCamp Incubator 2.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:53:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"WordCamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5577\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by a team of local WordPress users who have a passion for growing their communities.

In the case of the questions &#8220;What is the best thing about WordPress?&#8221; and &#8220;What is the most frustrating thing about WordPress?&#8221; we listed the five most common responses, aggregated when applicable. In the case of the question “What is your gender?” in the 2016 and 2017 surveys, we aggregated responses as best we could.

In addition to using up and down arrows, this version introduces the ability to sort blocks by <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/6041\">dragging and dropping</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you hover the cursor over the up and down arrows on the left side of a block, you&#8217;ll see a hand icon. Simply click, hold, and drag the block up or down below or above the blue indicator.</p>\n\n\n    \n\n\n<p>In my limited testing, I found drag and drop to be hit or miss. Sometimes, when I try to drag and drop a block, the blue line doesn&#8217;t show up.</p>\n\n<p>The hand icon for the cursor is different for the top and bottom of the block. You can drag a block by hovering over the bottom of it but you can&#8217;t do it from the top.</p>\n\n<img />\n    Hovering the cursor at the top of the block\n\n\n<img />\n    Hovering the cursor at the bottom of the block\n\n\n<p>I also found it difficult to add a new block manually. For example, when I add a paragraph block, I don&#8217;t see the Plus icon to create a new block underneath it anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Pressing enter at the end of a paragraph creates a new Paragraph block automatically. But I don&#8217;t know how to transform it into an image block.

Riad Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/5902\">figured out</a> why meta boxes were not collapsing or expanding.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that some meta boxes depend on the post script which has a side effect of calling the window.postboxes.add_postbox_toggles( postType ) twice, causing meta boxes to break.</p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg 2.6 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/05/whats-new-in-gutenberg-5th-april/\">released earlier this week</a>, fixes the issue and all meta boxes function properly again. This also fixes the issue I had with the Telegram for WordPress plugin. <br /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/public-post-preview/\">Public Post Preview</a> still doesn&#8217;t work in Gutenberg but the plugin&#8217;s developer, Dominik Schilling, shared some experiments he has conducted with adding support for Gutenberg on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n    <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can\'t wait for seeing Gutenberg in WordPress core. So many new possibilities. Even for Public Post Preview (<a href=\"https://t.co/Xsw9hugxKT\">https://t.co/Xsw9hugxKT</a>). With just a few lines I was able to create this: <a href=\"https://t.co/fxyuBIMPOl\">pic.twitter.com/fxyuBIMPOl</a></p>&mdash; Dominik Schilling <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f30a.png\" alt=\"🌊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@ocean90) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ocean90/status/980420608822562816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2018</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<p>In the preview video, you can see Public Post Preview&#8217;s options added to the sidebar and in addition to generating a link, you can choose when that URL expires which is better than what&#8217;s currently available in the plugin.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned how Tags would sometimes disappear and there overall behavior was inconsistent. This <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/5913\">pull request </a>that made it into Gutenberg 2.6, fixes the issue by only including the term in the Tag selector if it&#8217;s known.</p>\n\n<p>Although I&#8217;m still bummed that certain plugins are not yet compatible with Gutenberg, I&#8217;m pretty happy that two of the major pain points I experienced have been fixed. Thanks to Riad, Tammie Lister, and others for helping to solve these problems so quickly. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 21:29:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: A WordCamp for Organizers Is in the Planning Stages\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=79513\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/a-wordcamp-for-organizers-is-in-the-planning-stages\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2684:\"<p>Last year, Drew Jaynes and Carol Stambaugh <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/08/16/proposed-event-wordcamp-for-wordcamp-organizers/\">proposed</a> a new WordCamp event geared towards organizers to the WordPress Community Team. After fleshing out the details and discussing the idea over the course of seven months, the duo <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/04/03/want-to-help-organize-a-wordcamp-for-organizers/\">has announced</a> that a WordCamp for Organizers is officially on the table.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the event is to provide an opportunity for meetup and WordPress event organizers to share their experience with others in the community. The plan is to host a one-day event a day or two before <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> in Nashville, TN, later this year.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea for WordCamp for Organizers – what some of us affectionately refer to as &#8216;dotOrganize&#8217; – was really borne out of many conversations I’ve had over the years with others in the WordPress community lamenting the lack of a ready knowledge sharing opportunity between event organizers,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;One common thread seemed to be the idea of common lessons learned, and how awesome it would be to just have an event for organizers to get together and swap tips and tricks. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We’re all here organizing the same community, maybe we should get together and trade notes! And so we now have a new topic-based WordCamp just for organizers. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s kind of meta – organizing a WordCamp for Organizers, but I really feel like this could be a boon for anybody currently organizing or looking to start organizing in WordPress. Exciting!&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Some of the session topics that could be presented on include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Spreading the word about your community events</li>\n    <li>Tips for wrangling speakers, volunteers, and sponsors</li>\n    <li>Conflict resolution among organizing teams</li>\n    <li>How to respond to a code of conduct issue</li>\n    <li>Finding and using official organizing tools and resources<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The team is seeking volunteers who can spend 2-4 hours per week to help organize the event. Although it&#8217;s focused on organizers, those who have attended many conferences, including WordCamps, with little event organizing experience, are encouraged to join the team.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in volunteering, please leave a comment on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/04/03/want-to-help-organize-a-wordcamp-for-organizers/\">official announcement post</a>. </p>\n\n<p><br /></p><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 00:22:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 6.0 Takes Steps Towards GDPR Compliance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=79459\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-6-0-takes-steps-towards-gdpr-compliance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1148:\"<p>Jetpack 6.0 <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2018/04/03/jetpack-6-0/\">is available</a> for upgrade.

Ironically, at 43 years old I was more fit and healthy than I had ever been in my entire life. I had been running road marathons and trail ultra marathons for a few years leading up to my diagnosis. Good thing too, because surgery and treatment were obviously very tough.</p>\n<p>I was transitioning my design studio from analog to digital. Previously, I was working as a professional artist and illustrator creating commission portraiture and college mascot illustrations with some moderate successes. My background is in Fine Art and Design. I studied Drawing, Sculpture, &amp; Time Arts. (2D, 3D &amp; 4D &#8211; 4D can be described as: Length, width, height, and time/ motion) Naturally, as a Time Arts artist/illustrator I love the web! I love designing for the web and mobile too. Web work is immediately gratifying. I do design for both the web and print but I have always felt drawn to the web as it is more accessible, more fluid, dynamic, interconnected, animated, media rich, and well … if you are reading this then you already get the picture. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<blockquote><p>To get through treatment it was important to me that I still work every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some days it was just a couple hours in the afternoon but it really helped me to cope and endure unplanned surgery and many painful chemotherapy treatments. I had recently completed a couple of websites with the help of my mentor Jerry Turk. Those sites had good reach. I mean they were the kind of sites that groups of people used and managed so I got some attention for the work and word of mouth spread locally.</p>\n<p>It was while getting through that period of treatment and the shock of a devastating diagnosis that my digital design agency really got legs. It could not have happened at a better time. So, my studio, C&amp;D Studios &#8211; <a href=\"https://CandDStudios.com\">https://CandDStudios.com</a> continued it’s move towards being 100% digital. No more analog photography and not much more drawing at the drawing table either. Now my work was nearly 100% focused on screens and it would also begin to pay the bills. That was eight years ago. I was very fortunate to learn using reliable frameworks, themes, plug-ins, and hosts that would also stand the test of time. Thank you Genesis Framework, StudioPress and Gravity Forms to name a few…</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2016 after having been cancer free all those years and cranking out a lot of agency work, I had a cancer reoccurrence. I never wanted cancer to be part of my story and I tried to deny or overcome it in all ways but it had resurfaced in October of 2016. Professionally, I was involved in collaborating on very large scale enterprise sites with teams. I was spending the year testing the waters at a new level of production. It was not good timing to require another surgery and 18 more rounds of chemotherapy. Fortunately, I found support in the community from other designers and developers whom helped me to the finish lines with 3 large projects in areas of e-commerce, college membership and enterprise site work -one with a large volume of SVG animations. After surgery, in February of 2017 I completed 18 rounds of chemotherapy treatments.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have survived and am cancer free once again!</p></blockquote>\n<p>While going through treatment the second time I was not really focused on what good thing will I be able to grow towards professionally. Honestly, when you go through these things in life &#8211; you just spend your energy getting through as best as you can. I think it is worth noting here that while a positive attitude is great and it can improve a patient’s overall experience. Please don’t tell people they will survive cancer because of their positive attitude. Cancer is horrible, it does not discriminate and when people can’t beat a disease with their mental attitude they end up blaming themselves unnecessarily. That is not good. That is not what people intend when then try to offer support in that way but that is something I wanted to share.</p>\n<p>Now I have landed on the other side of treatment again and as I reflect, it’s been a really epic year! Our WordPress community has been open and supportive, welcoming me at conferences, online, and in slack groups, whether I had hair, energy, or resources &#8211; always welcoming and always encouraging. Over the years I have made some wonderful friends through WordPress! Some of us have been at this for a long time and we now have many shared experiences and skills.</p>\n<h3>Having Survived Again I’m Launching a WordPress Product</h3>\n<p>Having survived again, and having been inspired at PressNomics in Tempe last spring, I’m busy launching a mobile product/service with my team Dr. Kendra Remington and Rita Best called <a href=\"https://docswithapps.com\">Docs With Apps</a>.</p>\n<p>I still accept some client work, and some retainer work but I’m pretty selective about the projects we work on “in house.”</p>\n<p>I love SVG animation work so in 2018 I’m overjoyed to be doing more contracted SVG animation work with my collaborator Jackie D’Elia. Hit us up!!</p>\n<p>These are some very wonderful times in technology and within the Internet of things. I feel very grateful to have been able to ride the digital wave into the present and future. At WCUS in Nashville I began the process of contributing to make WordPress after having spent many years empowering others with it.</p>\n<p>When I was young I needed a way to get my portfolio on line and that is how I got started. Thank you for the opportunity to share my story, to publicly thank my husband Dominic, my family, and friends too. The future is going to be awesome!</p>\n<p>Take care of yourself and of each other, it&#8217;s very important.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Year%20I%20Got%20Cancer%20Was%20The%20Year%20My%20WordPress%20Business%20Took%20Off&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off%2F&title=The+Year+I+Got+Cancer+Was+The+Year+My+WordPress+Business+Took+Off\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/the-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/040418-150x150.jpg&description=The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off/\" title=\"The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off/\">The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:00:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cathi Bosco\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9.5 Squashes 25 Bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=79399\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-5-squashes-25-bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:940:\"<p>WordPress 4.9.5 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/\">is available</a> for download and is a maintenance and security release.

Jadon N who works for InMotion hosting and is a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">#hosting-community slack channel</a>, says the hosting-community group is working on ideas to help test popular plugins for Gutenberg compatibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n    <p>We have been working to expand our collection of data about how well plugins function with Gutenberg. To help with that effort, we would like to explore using feedback collected from WordPress users through the Try Gutenberg effort to add to the existing database on WordPress plugin compatibility if that could be worked out. </p>\n    <p>The goal of this project is to make sure everyone can use Gutenberg without having to worry about plugin incompatibilities.</p><cite>Jadon N</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/\">Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database project</a> launched by Daniel Bachhuber last month attempts to determine which popular plugins are already compatible with Gutenberg by having volunteers test them in a sandboxed environment.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the 4,213 plugins in the database, 84% have an unknown compatibility status. Out of 610 plugins that have been tested, 82% don&#x27;t include editor functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Pendergast <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:92\">supports the idea</a> of hosts collecting a wide range of testing data and turning it into actionable items for the team to work on. There&#x27;s also been some discussion on creating snapshots of plugin compatibility and filtering those results into Bachhuber&#x27;s project.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Lema, Vice President of Products at LiquidWeb, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:98\">responded</a> in the trac ticket with a suggestion that the team place as much emphasis on the Learn More and Report Issues sections as the Try Gutenberg message. He also added a prototype screenshot of what the call-out could look like. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    Gutenberg Call Out Prototype by Chris Lema\n\n\n<p>\"The reality is that people don&#x27;t read a lot, so people may not fully grasp the &#x27;testing&#x27; part given the proposed design,\" Lema said. \"When there are equal weight to the design, the message also carries with it the same equality.\"</p>\n\n<p>One of the best suggestions I&#x27;ve read comes <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:98\">from Bachhuber</a>. He suggests displaying the prompt to a small percentage of WordPress sites to prevent thousands of users from re-reporting known issues with Gutenberg.

Read on to find out more about what happened during the month of March.\n\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>WordPress Now Powers 30% of the Internet</h2>\n\n<p>Over the last 15 years, the popularity and usage of WordPress has been steadily growing. That growth hit a significant milestone this month when <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">W3Techs reported that WordPress now powers over 30% of sites on the web.</a></p>\n\n<p>The percentage is determined based on W3Techs’ review of the top 10 million sites on the web, and it’s a strong indicator of the popularity and flexibility of WordPress as a platform.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to have hand in helping to grow WordPress even further, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">you can get involved today</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Jargon Glossary Goes Live</h2>\n\n<p>The WordPress Marketing Team has been hard at work lately putting together <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2018/02/28/wordpress-jargon-glossary/\">a comprehensive glossary of WordPress jargon</a> to help newcomers to the project become more easily acquainted with things.</p>\n\n<p>The glossary <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2018/02/28/wordpress-jargon-glossary/\">is available here</a> along with a downloadable PDF to make it simpler to reference offline.</p>\n\n<p>Publishing this resource is part of an overall effort to make WordPress more easily accessible for people who are not so familiar with the project.

It has reinforced the commitment of the GDPR Compliance Team to continue working on enhancements to WordPress core that allow site owners to improve privacy standards.</p>\n\n<p>The team&#x27;s work, and the wider privacy project, spans four areas: Adding tools which will allow site administrators to collect the information they need about their sites, examining the plugin guidelines with privacy in mind, enhancing privacy standards in WordPress core, and creating documentation focused on best practices in online privacy.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved with the project, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/28/roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/\">view the roadmap</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gdpr-compliance/\">follow the updates</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&keywords=~gdpr\">submit patches</a>, and join the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

In Gutenberg, that option doesn&#x27;t exist. According to a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatibility-with-gutenberg/\">recent support forum post</a>, the author does not plan on making it Gutenberg compatible until there is a finalized API to extend the sidebar.</p>\n\n<h2>Telegram for WordPress</h2>\n\n<p>We use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/telegram-for-wp/\">Telegram for WordPress</a> plugin to automatically send published posts to our Telegram channel. The plugin adds a meta box that has options to send the post, configure the message structure, send a file, and display the featured image.</p>\n\n<p>In Gutenberg, the meta box is open by default which provides access to those options. However, when I edit a published post, there are times when the meta box is closed and clicking the arrow to expand it doesn&#x27;t work. <em>Since the Send this post to channel</em> option is on by default, ﻿saving changes to the post will resend the post to Telegram subscribers. Something I don&#x27;t want to happen for simple edits. <br /></p>\n\n<h2>Edit Flow</h2>\n\n<p>We use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/\">Edit Flow</a> to collaborate on posts and often use the Editorial Comments feature to provide feedback. In Gutenberg, the meta boxes for Editorial Comments and Notifications do not open when clicking the arrow. Therefor, we can&#x27;t use those features. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    <br /><br />Edit Flow Meta Boxes are Broken\n\n\n<h2>After the Deadline</h2>\n\n<p>I&#x27;m a fan of <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/spelling-and-grammar/\">After the Deadline</a> which is a proofreading module in Jetpack. It checks posts for spelling, grammar, and misused words. When activated, a button is added to the visual editor to perform the checks. This button is not available in Gutenberg, so those features are not available as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Adding Images to Paragraphs is a Pain</h2>\n\n<p>Adding images to paragraphs in Gutenberg is more cumbersome than it needs to be. In the current editor, all I have to do is place the cursor where I want to insert an image, add media, choose image size, align it, and I&#x27;m done.</p>\n\n<p>In Gutenberg, you need to create an image block below the paragraph block, move the image block to the paragraph block, align it, and use handlebars on the corner of the image to resize it. </p>\n\n<p>I realize that there are a few workflows that I&#x27;m going to have to change because of how Gutenberg works, but this workflow doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me, especially when I can&#x27;t insert images without creating a new block. Thankfully, the Gutenberg team is on top of it and is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/5794\">working on a solution</a> to add images within a paragraph block.</p>\n\n<h2>Random Blank Paragraph Blocks</h2>\n\n<p>I recently copied a large amount of text from a Google Doc and pasted it into Gutenberg and was surprised by how well it worked. Blocks were created in the right spots and I didn&#x27;t have to edit it much.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the post in the classic editor so that I could use the proofreading feature and it mangled the post. I opened the post in Gutenberg again and noticed a bunch of empty paragraph blocks created in-between paragraph blocks.</p>\n\n<p>This resulted in having to spend some time deleting the empty paragraph blocks and questioning whether I should avoid transferring posts between editors in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>Tags Sometimes Appear Blank in the Meta Box</h2>\n\n<p>When adding tags to posts, sometimes the tags appear blank although they show up on the front-end. Also, deleting tags sometimes doesn&#x27;t work. I click on the X and nothing happens in the back-end, but the tag will be removed from the front-end. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    Blank Tags in Gutenberg\n\n\n<h2>Gutenberg Has a Lot of Rough Edges</h2>\n\n<p>If this version of Gutenberg were merged into WordPress today, it would be a disaster. It&#x27;s clear that the project has a long way to go before being considered for merge into core. Most of the issues I&#x27;ve outlined in this post are known and are being addressed. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg is supposed to make everything we do in the current editor easier and more efficient. If it doesn&#x27;t, then I have to ask, what&#x27;s the point?</p>\n\n<p>What concerns me the most about Gutenberg is plugin support. Some of the plugins I mentioned above are active on 10K sites or less but are important to the way I craft and publish content in WordPress. <br /></p>\n\n<p> Without them, using Gutenberg is not a great experience and instead, makes me want to use the current editor where things simply work. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:28:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"HeroPress: Giving Back In Your Own Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2490\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"https://heropress.com/giving-back-in-your-own-community/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=giving-back-in-your-own-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3298:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GoodtimeToBe-HeroPress-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull quote: It is a good time to be part of the global WordPress community: the costs are low, the developer community is strong, and job availability is at an all time high.\" /><p>I was delighted to find several years ago that there&#8217;s a thriving WordPress community in Nepal.

While a date was not given, Mullenweg said, \"For those who want a concrete date, we will have one or two orders of magnitude more users of Gutenberg in April.\"</p>\n\n<p>It&#x27;s now clear what he meant by that. WordPress 4.9.5, scheduled for release in April, will <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316\">feature a call-out prompt</a> that has links to information about Gutenberg and a button to quickly install the plugin if user permissions allow. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    Gutenberg Call-out in WordPress 4.9.5\n\n\n<p>The core team added a Try Gutenberg prompt in October of last year but <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-beta-4-removes-try-gutenberg-call-to-action\">it was removed</a> in WordPress 4.9 Beta 4. After discussing the subject with Mullenweg, it was determined that Gutenberg was not ready for large-scale testing.</p>\n\n<p>The prompt in WordPress 4.9.5 changes the button text based on the following scenarios.<br /></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is not installed, <em>and</em> the user can install plugins, the Install Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is installed but not activated, <em>and</em> the user can install plugins, the Activate Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is installed and activated, <em>and</em> the user can edit posts, the Try Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If Gutenberg is not installed and the user can not install plugins, the button is hidden from view. If you&#x27;d like to hide the prompt from users, David Decker has <a href=\"https://github.com/deckerweb/remove-gutenberg-panel\">created a plugin</a> that&#x27;s available on GitHub that simply hides it from view.</p>\n\n<p>One of the concerns about the prompt is the lack of warning of the risks involved using beta software on a live site. Gutenberg is beta software that&#x27;s still in development that could <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:75\">adversely affect sites</a>. There is no warning on the call-out box and in two clicks, users can install and activate Gutenberg. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Whether it&#x27;s Gutenberg or some other beta software, this general advice applies. Create a full backup of your site before installing and if possible, install it on a staging site first.</p>\n\n<p>I predict that the volunteers who manage the WordPress.org support forums will have their hands full once WordPress 4.9.5 is released. The support team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/2018/03/agenda-for-march-22nd-support-meeting/\">is preparing</a> by brainstorming user outcomes, common questions that may be asked, and potential pitfalls users experience after installing Gutenberg. <br /></p>\n\n<p>If you&#x27;d like to give them a helping hand, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/\">Support Handbook</a> and if you have any questions, stop by the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fforums%2F\">#forums</a> channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Gutenberg call-out has the potential to pave the way for large audiences to test major features in core without needing to use or install a beta branch of WordPress. However, this convenience comes with risks and while they can be reduced, WordPress needs to be up front and center to users about those risks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 22:55:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WPTavern: Why Gutenberg and Why Now?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78707\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://wptavern.com/why-gutenberg-and-why-now\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17921:\"<img />\n\n<p>Tevya Washburn has been building websites for more than 20 years and building them on WordPress for 10. He bootstrapped his website maintenance and support company, <a href=\"http://wordx.press\">WordXpress</a>, that he’s worked on full-time for more than seven years.</p>\n\n<p>Late last year he launched his first premium plugin, and presented at WordCamp Salt Lake City. He lives in Caldwell, ID and is the founding member of the WordPress Meetup group in Western Idaho. <br /></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>It was only a few months ago that I knew almost nothing about WordPress’ new Gutenberg editor. I had a basic concept of what it was and this vague annoyance that it would mean I’d have to learn new things and probably put a lot of effort into making some sites or projects work with it.</p>\n\n<p>I kept hearing all of the frustration and issues with Gutenberg itself and the lack of information on how to integrate with it. At <a href=\"https://wordx.press\">WordX</a>p<a href=\"https://wordx.press\">ress</a> we recently pivoted away from designing websites. When we designed them in the past, we used premium themes. I figured Gutenberg was the theme developer’s problem.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I still had this feeling of dread though, knowing many of my favorite plugins might not add support for it. I also felt some apprehension that even if the themes we use did add support for it, they might have a lot of new bugs through the first few releases.</p>\n\n<p>Then I launched my first WordPress plugin, <a href=\"https://starfishwp.com\">Starfish Reviews</a>, and suddenly they weren’t someone else’s problems anymore! Now I’d have to come up with a plan to integrate our plugin with Gutenberg. I installed the Gutenberg plugin on a test site where we were testing our plugin with the nightly releases of WordPress and started playing around with it.</p>\n\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive and easy it was to use! Now it wasn’t (and isn’t) finished, so there were bugs and annoyances, but overall I was impressed.</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time, I suggested we should have someone present on Gutenberg at our local meetup. My brief experience was more than what anyone else had, so the responsibility fell on me. Preparing for the presentation forced me to look at Gutenberg more carefully and pay more attention to the information and debate going on throughout the community.</p>\n\n<p>I started reading blog posts, paying more attention in podcasts, and even looking at what was being said on Twitter. I watched the State of the Word at WordCamp US where the general tide in the feelings toward Gutenberg, seemed to turn, though many people still remain skeptical, critical, or antagonistic toward the project as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I saw someone suggesting legal action if Gutenberg caused problems on their sites. That’s ridiculous on several levels, but shows that there’s still a lot of suspicion, frustration, and outright anger around Gutenberg.</p>\n\n<p><em>A couple notes: 1. the graphs below are for illustration purposes only, they’re not meant to be accurate to any actual data. 2. If you prefer listening, you can </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ZqrVJ465E\"><em>watch my screencast version</em></a><em> (13:12) of what follows. The message is the same, but differs in many aspects of presentation.</em></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Finding the Why</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Simon Sinek is known for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA\">his Ted talk</a> where he explains that most people explain a new product or service by talking about ‘what’ it is and ‘how’ it works, but they rarely explain the ‘why’ behind it. The ‘why’ actually resonates with people the most. They want to understand the reason and beliefs behind it.</p>\n\n<p>In my research, I couldn’t seem to find a clear answer to the most important question: “Why Gutenberg?” If I was going to present to people who knew little or nothing about it, I wanted to provide a reason why this major change was coming that might cause significant frustration, work, and pain for them.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>I found a lot of ‘what’ and ‘how’ about Gutenberg. In some posts by <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/\">Matías Ventura</a>, I found hints about ‘why’ Gutenberg existed, but no really clear, simple explanation of why this whole project was happening. Why would Matt and others want to seemingly force this major change on us all? Why does it have to be such a radical departure from the past? Why now?</p>\n\n<p>I was certain the conspiracy theorists—who seem to believe that Automattic’s sole mission is to make their lives more miserable—were wrong. But what was the purpose? Could it really just be a <strong>me too</strong> attitude that left all of these brilliant minds feeling like they had to keep up with Squarespace and Medium? That didn’t seem to fit. Especially since Gutenberg is already leagues better than Squarespace’s convoluted visual editor.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Innovative Disruption</strong></h2>\n\n<img />\n    The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma Book Cover\n\n\n<p>Taking cues from those hints and suggestions, I started thinking about the innovative disruption model. It was popularized in business circles, starting in 1997 when the book “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma\">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>” was published by Clayton Christensen, a Harvard professor. His book was an expansion of an <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave\">earlier article</a> in the Harvard Business Review.</p>\n\n<p>At the risk of oversimplifying the model, innovative disruption is what happens when an existing company who is the top dog (either in sales or market share) gets comfortable with their position at the top along with their revenue stream and quits innovating. They make small, incremental updates to their products or services to keep customers happy, but fail to look at the future of their industry.</p>\n\n<p>This makes it easier for a startup or smaller, more innovative company to bring a new product or service to market that completely disrupts the existing market because it’s better, faster, cheaper. The established company doesn’t see the disruption coming because they feel secure in their large market share and steady sales revenue. They often respond with “why would anyone want that?” when approached with the new model that is about to completely upset their business model.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Blockbuster Gets Busted</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The classic example of this is Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc. They had over 9,000 stores at one time, allowing people to rent VHS tapes and later, DVDs. They had a huge portion of the market all to themselves and it seemed nobody could compete with this juggernaut.</p>\n\n<p>Then along came two small startups: Netflix and Redbox. Netflix comes along and says “we’re going to stream movies over the internet. That’s the future and the way everyone will want to consume movies and TV in the future. But since the internet is too slow right now, we’ll just start by mailing DVDs to people.”</p>\n\n<p>Blockbuster looked at this and said, “the internet is <em>way</em> too slow to stream movies. That’s ridiculous! Who wants to wait two weeks to get a movie in the mail?! Hahaha! Stupid startup, they’re wasting their money and energy.” In hindsight this seems ridiculous. At the time, most people would have agreed with Blockbuster.</p>\n\n<p>As you know, people started changing the way they rented movies. Once they tried it, they were happy to pay a subscription and use a queue to get DVDs delivered in the mail. Ultimately, making the decision of what to watch ahead of time was better than wandering through a cathedral of DVDs only to find the one you wanted to watch has already been checked out.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer internet bandwidth speeds quickly caught up. Netflix even invented some of the technologies that provide high quality streaming video to your home. Now, most of us can’t imagine having to go to the store to rent a physical copy of a movie. And those that can, get them from a Redbox kiosk that has a limited selection, but is much quicker and easier than a video store. Netflix now has a larger market share than Blockbuster ever did, with <em>zero</em> physical locations.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>There are exactly nine Blockbuster stores still operating, mostly in Alaska. From 9,000 down to nine in only a few years! This is what failing to innovate does. This is how comfort and confidence in market share and sales blinds people and organizations to the coming innovations that will disrupt their market.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Literacy, Disruption, and Gutenberg</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Disruptive innovation doesn’t apply just in business. I have a Bachelor’s degree in history. So one example I love to use is how literacy and education ultimately toppled monarchies and traditional power structures in favor of republics and representative democracy.</p>\n\n<p>The choice of Gutenberg as the name of the new WordPress editor seems prescient in this example as well. The name was one of the clues that led me to answer the ‘why?’ question. It was Johannes Gutenberg and his movable type printing press that was the innovative disruption that changed everything!</p>\n\n<p>Before that, the vast majority of people in Europe were illiterate and uneducated. The scarcity of books and written material made it impractical and prohibitively expensive for most people to learn to read. It also allowed the Church and aristocracy to control the opportunity to become literate. That meant the rich and powerful were the gatekeepers of knowledge. Most riots and uprisings to this point were about hunger.</p>\n\n<p>The Gutenberg press changed all that. Suddenly books could be mass-produced faster, cheaper, better than they ever could before. Literacy caught on like a wildfire. The power structures thought they could control it and maintain the status quo. They outlawed printing without state approval and did many other things to limit the spread of ideas through printed materials.</p>\n\n<p>But it was too late, the power to spread ideas that the printing press provided was much too viral. Many printing presses were operated illegally, then destroyed when they were discovered by authorities.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>The tipping point had been reached though. The ability to read and spread ideas via printed documents was much more powerful than the money, soldiers, and weapons of the monarchy. Though hunger might have sparked riots and uprisings from this time on, those tiny flames were fanned into an inferno of revolution by ideas spread through printed words. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine\">Thomas Paine</a>’s Common Sense is a great example if you want to learn more about concrete examples.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Pain of Disrupting Yourself</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I don’t have a business degree, but from my understanding, <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> can be simplified down to this: to survive, and stay on top, a company (or software, or community) must innovate. It <em>can not</em> be incremental innovation. It <em>must</em> be innovation that disrupts the company’s core product or business model, even to the point of entirely replacing it.</p>\n\n<p>Blockbuster tried some Redbox-like and Netflix-like solutions, but they were too little, too late. The only way they could have survived would have been to disrupt their own business model and service. They would have had to say, “in five years we will close all 9k stores and completely shift our business to providing video online.”</p>\n\n<p>Who does that? Who thinks “we have built an empire, but we have to completely change it and replace it all over again”? That’s “The Innovator’s Dilemma” that the book’s title refers to: it’s incredibly difficult to think in those terms when you’re on the top. It’s nearly impossible to say, “we have to disrupt ourselves. We must compete with our own business and products and services.” But ultimately it’s the only way to survive.</p>\n\n<p>…Or you can buy an innovative company and let them disrupt your main business. Did you know Blockbuster had the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blockbuster-ceo-passed-up-chance-to-buy-netflix-for-50-million-2015-7\">chance to buy Netflix</a> for $50 million in 2000? It was pocket change, but they passed because it was a very small, niche business.</p>\n\n<p>Had they bought Netflix and allowed it to continue innovating and disrupting their core retail rental model, Blockbuster might still be around. It wouldn’t have 9k retail stores, but it would have an even larger market share than it ever did renting DVDs.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>In either case, the process is painful. That’s why it’s called disruptive. Not because it’s a walk on the beach or small speed bump, but because it takes a lot of work and forward-thinking and causes a lot of pain to create and implement.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the market leader, you can’t rest on your previous success. You have to change everything once again, like you did to get to where you are now. Despite the pain of doing it, you have to invest yourself and your resources into hard work and difficult questions and challenging thinking that goes directly counter to our natural tendency as humans. If you want to stay on top, it’s the only way.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>WordPress is Ripe for Disruption</strong></h2>\n\n<p>WordPress has a 30% market share right now. It won’t be long before 1 out of every 3 websites is built on WordPress. No other platform is even close.</p>\n\n<p>As WordPress professionals and community members, it seems like we have all the momentum and benefits of being the leader. “Surely nothing could displace WordPress!” That’s what Blockbuster said. That’s what monarchs of past ages said. The truth is simple: “yes, something could. In fact, something will, if WordPress doesn’t innovatively disrupt itself.”</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>Is it going to be painful? Yes. Is it going to cause a lot of work and effort on the part of the community? Yes! Absolutely. But the alternative is to learn a totally new platform in five years when WordPress dies like Blockbuster did. You think this change is going to be difficult? Try throwing out WordPress entirely and moving your website(s) to an entirely new platform. Because that’s the alternative.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Good Arguments Against Gutenberg</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I see many people listing a string of bugs in the Gutenberg UI/UX and concluding that Gutenberg shouldn’t exist. I see others critiquing the underlying technologies and claiming that’s evidence that Gutenberg is entirely wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sorry, but those arguments are entirely invalid. They may be great arguments for how Gutenberg needs to change or improve, but they are <em>not</em> valid arguments against the existence of Gutenberg and its inclusion in core.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, I’ve made it clear that WordPress is in dire need of innovation. If that’s true, then as I see it, there’s only one really great argument against Gutenberg. As one person in one of the meetups I presented at put it: “is it the right innovation?”</p>\n\n<p>That&#x27;s the crux of the whole thing: <strong>WordPress must innovate to survive</strong>. Matt Mullenweg and the entire Gutenberg team have looked at the past and the future and decided that a better, faster, easier user interface and experience, are the disruptive innovations that WordPress needs to survive.</p>\n\n<p>You can argue that it’s not, that there’s some other innovation that will completely change WordPress and thereby save it from disruption by outside forces. And that&#x27;s a totally valid argument to make. But in my opinion, <strong>you can’t argue that continued, incremental changes are enough.</strong> You can’t argue that the path we’ve been on the last five years is going to keep WordPress on top for the next five years. It simply won’t.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>I Like Gutenberg, but I Love What it’s Doing</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In my experience thus far, I like Gutenberg. I believe it is the right disruptive innovation WordPress needs at this time. It will make WordPress easier to use and help its underpinnings be ready for the future. Being easy to use is what got WordPress where it is today.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not very easy to use any more. There are significantly easier options out there, that could disrupt WordPress and replace it. I think Gutenberg will allow WordPress to disrupt itself and keep ahead of other disruptive innovations. It will save WordPress and allow us all to keep using it and building our businesses on it for another 10 years into the future.</p>\n\n<p>I like Gutenberg, but I really love what Gutenberg means, what it represents, and what it&#x27;s doing. Gutenberg is bigger than just a new post editor, it shows that the leaders of the WordPress community are willing to make hard decisions and innovate even when it means disrupting their own work and previous innovations.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>I have huge respect for the Gutenberg team, who have not only had to rethink everything and do all those difficult things I referred to before, but have had to do it all very publicly, while navigating a gauntlet of criticism, personal attacks, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this post shows my thanks and newfound appreciation for what they’re doing and going through. Flipping the phrase from <em>The Dark Knight,</em> the members of the Gutenberg team are “the heroes the WordPress community needs right now, even if they’re not the ones we deserve.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 18:20:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Post Status: The Future of Content Distribution — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=44599\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://poststatus.com/future-content-distribution-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2385:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

As most of you can probably imagine, BuddyPress was a different piece of software back then, trying to solve a completely different decade&#8217;s worth of problems for a completely different version of WordPress.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress was multisite only, meaning it did not work on the regular version of WordPress that most people were accustomed to installing. It needed to completely take over the entire website experience to work, with a specific theme for the primary part of your site, and blog themes for user profiles and everything else.</p>\n<p>There was a lot to love about the original vision and version of BuddyPress. It was ambitious, but in a clever kind of way that made everyone tilt their heads, squint their eyes, and ponder what WordPress was capable of. BuddyPress knew exactly what it was trying to do, and owned it without apologies.</p>\n<p>It touted itself as a &#8220;Social Network in a box&#8221; at a time when MySpace was generating 75.9 million <em>unique</em> visitors per month, so if you couldn&#8217;t imagine how different BuddyPress may have been before, imagine how excited everyone was at the idea of owning their own MySpace.</p>\n<p>Since then, Andy invited <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges\">Boone</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/djpaul\">Paul</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby\">me</a> to help lead the project forward, and in-turn we&#8217;ve invited several other prolific BuddyPress contributors to help with every aspect of the project, website, design, and so on.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress team has grown in a few different ways. Most recently, we&#8217;ve added <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/espellcaste\">Renato Alves</a> to the team to help with WP-CLI support. Renato is a long-time contributor who stepped up big-time to really own the WP-CLI implementation and finally see it through to the end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/slaffik\">Slava Abakumov</a> lead the 2.8 release, and we finally met in person for the very first time just last week at WordCamp Miami. He&#8217;s another long-time contributor who has always had the best interests of the project in mind and at heart.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/offereins\">Laurens Offereins</a> has been helping fix BuddyPress bugs and work on evolving features since version 2.1, and while we haven&#8217;t met in person <em>yet</em>, I look forward to it someday!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/netweb\">Stephen Edgar</a> (who you may recognize from bbPress) also works a bit on BuddyPress, largely around tooling &amp; meta related things, but he&#8217;s fully capable and will jump in and help anywhere he can, be it the forums or features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mercime\">Mercime</a> would prefer I not blather on endlessly here about how important she is, or how much I appreciate her, or anything like that, so please forget I mentioned it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hnla\">Hugo Ashmore</a> has spent the past 2 years completely rebuilding the default template pack. This is an absolutely huge undertaking, and everyone is really excited about sunsetting ye olde <code>bp-legacy</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed\">Tammie Lister</a> has moved on to work on the enormously important and equally ambitious <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a> project. Tammie is wonderful, and doing a great job crafting what the future of democratizing publishing is.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a few of our veteran team members took sabbaticals from contributing to BuddyPress in the past few years, which I see as an opportunity to return with fresh ideas and perspectives, or maybe moving onto new &amp; exciting challenges. This is a good, healthy thing to do, both for oneself and the project. Space makes the heart grow fonder, and all that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A small aside but worth saying here &amp; now, is that leading an open-source project is everything you think it is (or maybe have read already that it is) and like a million other things that are hard to understand until you understand. The one constant (and subsequently the hardest and funnest part) is how to provide opportunities for personal growth, without prohibiting contributions, while also doing what&#8217;s best for the greater vision of the project itself, amongst a completely remote group of bespoke volunteers. I think Paul, Boone, and I do OK at this, but we are always learning and adjusting, so please reach out to us if there is anything we can do differently or better.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>BuddyPress is my personal favorite piece of software. It&#8217;s my favorite community. I wake up excited every day because of what it can do and who it does it for. Put another way, I love what we make it do and who we make it for: ourselves, one another, each other, and you.</p>\n<p>Cheers to 10 years, and here&#8217;s to another 10!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-271562 size-full\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-25-at-4.38.12-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"898\" height=\"452\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 22:54:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"JJJ\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: Noteworthy Changes Coming in WordPress 4.9.5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78611\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/noteworthy-changes-coming-in-wordpress-4-9-5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2401:\"<p>WordPress 4.9.5 Beta 1 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/21/wordpress-4-9-5-beta/\">is available</a> for testing and brings with it 23 bug fixes and improvements. A release candidate is scheduled for release on March 20th and a final release on April 3rd. Here are some notable changes you can expect in the release.</p>\n\n<h3>\"Cheatin’ uh?\" Error Message is Replaced</h3>\n\n<p>The \"Cheatin’ uh?\" error message has existed in WordPress for years and for some, is insulting. The error doesn&#x27;t explain what went wrong and accuses the user of trying to cheat the system.</p>\n\n<img />\n    Cheatin&#x27; Uh Error Message<br />\n\n\n<p>Eric Meyer highlighted the error in <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/06/24/eric-a-meyer-design-for-real-life/\">his keynote</a> at WordCamp North East Ohio in 2016, when talking about Designing for Real Life. He also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38332#comment:11\">contributed to the ticket</a> with suggestions on how to improve the wording.</p>\n\n<p>In WordPress 4.9.5, the error <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38332\">has been changed</a> to more meaningful messages depending on the error that occurs.</p>\n\n<h3>Recommended PHP Version Increased to 7.2</h3>\n\n<p>Inside of the readme file in WordPress, the current recommended PHP version is 7.0. This version of PHP reached end of life last December. In 4.9.5, the recommend version is PHP 7.2. This is the same version that is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\">recommended on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Offensive Lyrics Removed From Hello Dolly</h3>\n\n<p>As we covered <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/without-context-some-lyrics-inside-the-hello-dolly-plugin-are-degrading-to-women\">earlier this week</a>, some of the lines displayed in the dashboard from the Hello Dolly plugin are inappropriate without context. In 4.9.5, the plugin will no longer display those lines.</p>\n\n<p>There&#x27;s a possibility that in the future, there will be a musical note icon or symbol placed next to the line to indicate it&#x27;s from a song. In addition, the lyrics are more in line with Louis Armstrong&#x27;s recording.</p>\n\n<p>To see a full list of changes in WordPress 4.9.5, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=4.9.5&group=component\">view a full list</a> of closed tickets on Trac. </p>\n\n<p><br /></p><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 21:32:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 309 – All AMPed Up\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=78601&preview=true&preview_id=78601\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-309-all-amped-up\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2180:\"<p>In this episode, I&#8217;m joined by <a href=\"https://medinathoughts.com/\">Alberto Medina</a>, Developer Advocate working with the Web Content Ecosystems Team at Google, and <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/\">Weston Ruter</a>, CTO of XWP.

Last but not least, we learn about the relationship between Automattic, XWP, and the AMP team and how it&#8217;s helping to shape the future of the project.</p>\n<h2>Notable Links Mentioned:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">AMP for WordPress Plugin</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp\">AMP for WordPress GitHub Repository</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject\">AMP GitHub Repository</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGS-tKTXw4Y\">Video presentation from AMP Conf 2018 showcasing the work that&#8217;s gone into the AMP for WordPress plugin</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/standardizing-lessons-learned-from-amp/\">Official blog post outlining the future of the AMP Project</a></p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, March 28th 3:00 P.M.

At a time when WordPress and its community are doing what it can to be more inclusive, changing or removing the lyrics seems like an easy win. </p>\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 20:45:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Watch WordCamp Miami 2018 Via Free Livestream\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78359\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-wordcamp-miami-2018-via-free-livestream\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:618:\"<p>Tickets for the event may be sold out, but you can watch the event from anywhere thanks to a <a href=\"https://2018.miami.wordcamp.org/live/\">free livestream</a>.

Also of note is that <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-contributing-to-open-source\">less than half</a> of the respondents say they contribute to open source.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of interesting data points in the survey.

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Brian and Brian discuss the power of network effects and how they relate to WordPress’ increasing market share and maturity. WordPress has recently hit two major milestones, turning 15 years old and reaching 30% market share of the top 10 million websites, and we spend this episode reflecting on the innovations that brought us here and where innovations are likely to occur over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>We’ve come quite a long way in these 15 years. From the famous 5-minute install to being entirely pre-installed. From a supportive band of volunteers and vast ecosystem of free software to the commercially supported and highly-polished products that exist today. There is a lot about WordPress to be thankful for, and a lot of great things that will exist in the future because of it. And you can hear a bit about all of that on this episode of the Post Status Draft podcast.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8\">The Power of Network Effects</a></li>\n<li>Mel Choice&#8217;s LoopConf presentation on <a href=\"https://loopconf.com/talk/customizing-the-future/\">Customizing the Future</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: Yoast</h3>\n<p>Yoast SEO Premium gives you 24/7 support from a great support team and extra features such as a redirect manager, recommended internal links, tutorial videos and integration with Google Webmaster Tools!

Near the 23 minute mark, Choyce shows conceptual images of what the customization experience could be like when implemented with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>In the experimental images, you can see options to choose page templates or layouts, live previewing changes to blocks, global site styles, and a standard set of user interface patterns.

I&#8217;ll share what I did each time the growing business started to threaten my lifestyle, and how you can do the same.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>I had a traditional full-time job throughout my 20’s. I enjoyed building my career and earning a regular salary, but didn’t like the lack of flexibility that came with it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t like having to arrive at work by a fixed time, or being unable to choose when I worked. As a hard-working person, it felt counter-productive to be forced to work set hours when I may not be at my best.</p>\n<p>My daily commute was anything from 25-50 minutes (which I realise is less than many people). It felt like a waste of time as I could work just as well from home, not to mention the environmental impact of driving so far just to sit in an office. Day-to-day tasks such as ordering items for home delivery became a big deal, as I wasn’t home during the day.</p>\n<p>As a result, I spent most of my 20’s simultaneously building my career in a traditional job, while dreaming about running my own business and working for myself. Andy felt the same about his own job as a senior software developer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think that most people want a better lifestyle, but not many actually do anything about it. I thought I was one of those people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andy and I would talk endlessly about different business ideas (most of them terrible!) and even experimented with building a few websites that were never launched. However, we didn’t have the drive to make it happen and launch a business in the real world.</p>\n<h2>Starting a Business</h2>\n<p>In late 2009, Andy had finally had enough of his job and we agreed that it was time for him to quit. We decided to start a web design business together. He would work solely on the new business, while I would support it alongside my main job (which I didn&#8217;t hate, even though I didn&#8217;t like the lifestyle).</p>\n<p>We started by building WordPress websites for small local businesses. Andy built the websites and I was responsible for copywriting and marketing. We approached local tradespeople who didn&#8217;t already have a website &#8211; back in 2010, there were still a lot of these! Our first clients were local plumbers, electricians, a washing machine repair shop, etc.</p>\n<p>These early projects were quite low budget. The average hourly rate was quite low because we were still learning and hadn&#8217;t perfected our processes yet. We wasted a lot of time on projects where we had under-quoted but were committed to honoring the agreed price.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We made a lot of mistakes, and learned from them all!</p></blockquote>\n<p>By Year 2, the business was making the equivalent of a fairly low salary for one person. However, we had to work a lot for a relatively small income. This encouraged us to work more hours, and it wasn&#8217;t bringing the lifestyle benefits I was looking for.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #1: Learn to Specialize</h2>\n<p>In late 2010, it occurred to me that we were building all our websites in WordPress but not advertising ourself as a WordPress company. I wondered whether people were actually searching for WordPress experts and whether this could be a good way to advertise. That may seem obvious in 2018 now WordPress is the world&#8217;s biggest web platform &#8211; but it was a genuine question back in 2010.</p>\n<p>On a whim, I invested $100 in Google AdWords targeting keywords such as &#8216;WordPress web design&#8217; and &#8216;WordPress developer&#8217;. Amazingly, we were overwhelmed with enquiries and quickly brought in over $4,000 of business &#8211; not a bad return on investment! The work came from medium sized companies who had never used our services before, with higher budgets.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Positioning ourselves as WordPress specialists completely changed the profile of our client base, as well as the budgets we were working with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This vastly increased our average hourly income, so we were making more money without having to work more hours. Finally, it felt like a proper business with a better work-life balance.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #2: Build a (virtual) team</h2>\n<p>The business grew quickly under its new identity as a specialist WordPress agency. By mid-2011, we had more work than we could manage ourselves. I also had a baby and increased my hours on the business while on maternity leave &#8211; eventually not returning to my old job. We still needed to increase the company&#8217;s income, while working towards the lifestyle we wanted.</p>\n<p>We grew the business to the next level by building a virtual team.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt quite strongly that I didn&#8217;t want to become a traditional employer with a team of staff, all working together in an office. That would bring me back to the lifestyle I started with!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead, I decided to recruit a team of freelancers.</p>\n<p>It took time to find the right freelancers, but the good news is that you can try someone out on a single project with no further commitment. If it doesn&#8217;t work out, then you don&#8217;t have to work with them again. Through trial and error, I built a team of freelancers with different WordPress-related skills. This increased capacity and allowed us to take on more projects without having to work more hours.</p>\n<p>I was still managing all the projects, but could take a step back and wasn&#8217;t directly building the websites. Finally, it felt like a proper WordPress agency.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #3: Selling WordPress products</h2>\n<p>By building a distributed team, the business became more and more successful. We were taking on more and more projects, and I was managing all of them. By the time we were running 20 projects at once, I had reached the limits of my capacity and was having to work a lot of hours.</p>\n<p>From 2014-15, I experimented with working with freelance project managers, but had to give up because quality was dropping and our clients were less happy. I realised that with the current business model, I could only continue growing the business by working more and more hours. This wasn&#8217;t what I had been working towards!</p>\n<p>It was time for Andy and I to pursue our other dream: selling WordPress products. We&#8217;d been talking about this since the early days of the business, but the client projects had kept us so busy that we&#8217;d never done anything about it.</p>\n<p>In early 2016, Andy stepped out of the client business and started writing WordPress and WooCommerce plugins to sell. I continued managing client projects for the next 6 months, until the plugins were making enough money to stop taking on new projects and I could spend all my time marketing and supporting the plugins.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Selling WordPress plugins has been very successful because we already knew the market inside out from our years of developing WordPress sites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We knew where the gaps were and what plugin customers want. We knew where other plugin companies get it wrong, and could learn from their mistakes without making the same mistakes ourselves!</p>\n<p>By launching several plugins, we could listen to what our customers were asking for and build even more. In October 2016, we launched our <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-product-table/\">WooCommerce Product Table plugin</a> because so many people asked for a way to list products in a table with add to cart buttons. This immediately became our bestselling plugin and has sold more than all our other plugins combined. Since then, the plugin business has gone from strength to strength.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have found that selling WordPress products brings a much better work-life balance than providing WordPress services.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We receive (many) plugin support requests every day, but each one takes relatively little time and is less pressured than fixing problems for web design clients. The whole business feels much more relaxed, and I don&#8217;t feel guilty about taking time off.</p>\n<p>Between the two of us, we spend a couple of hours a day on plugin support. We continue improving the plugins, marketing, adding features and building the business on top of that. However, all of this is optional and can easily be done while working part-time.</p>\n<h2>Snow Day! Putting It Into Practice</h2>\n<p>Before we finish, I&#8217;ll tell you about my week. Today is Friday. At 10.30am on Wednesday, I received a text that my daughter&#8217;s school had closed for the rest of the week because of the unusual snow here in the UK.</p>\n<p>The parents with traditional jobs panicked and had to quickly arrange childcare or time-off work. Some of them were stuck in cars on snowed-in roads as they tried to return to the village. No one could get to work the next day. A lot of people lost a lot of money.</p>\n<p>Andy and I simply stopped work, put on our snow gear, walked the 10 minutes to the school, and then went sledging. Since then, we&#8217;ve been sharing the childcare in between responding to plugin support requests (and writing this article!). We&#8217;ve had 37 plugin sales on our website since the school closed, even though we&#8217;ve been working less hours than usual. Now, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been working towards!</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked hard and have been extremely committed to building Barn2 Media. However, this has always been on the condition that it wouldn&#8217;t sacrifice my lifestyle goals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, the ideal business is measured against a combination of financial success and lifestyle benefits. If the founders are working 70 hours a week to keep the money coming in, then it&#8217;s not a successful business!</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can do the same. Design a WordPress business that will give you the lifestyle you want, as well as making money. If you love working with people, build a team and provide WordPress services (WordPress design and development are good for this). If you want to travel, choose work that you can do remotely from different time zones (WordPress products are good for this). Plan your business around what matters to you.</p>\n<p>WordPress is such a huge ecosystem that it comes with many opportunities to build a successful business. With a bit of extra thought and planning, you can build a WordPress business that is successful AND lets you life the lifestyle you&#8217;ve always wanted. That is the true measure of success.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Building A New Life\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Building%20A%20New%20Life&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-a-new-life%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Building A New Life\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-a-new-life%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-a-new-life%2F&title=Building+A+New+Life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Building A New Life\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/building-a-new-life/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/030718-150x150.jpg&description=Building A New Life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Building A New Life\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-a-new-life/\" title=\"Building A New Life\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-a-new-life/\">Building A New Life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Mar 2018 08:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Katie Keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: WordPress Now Used on 30% of the Top 10 Million Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78214\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-now-used-on-30-of-the-top-10-million-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2379:\"<p><a href=\"https://w3techs.com/\">W3Techs</a>, a survey company that monitors usage of various web technologies, <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">is reporting</a> that WordPress has reached 30% usage or 60.2% market share of all the websites whose content management systems it knows about.

It turned out to be a complex, obscure vulnerability that ignited a conversation surrounding the security of api.wordpress.org and what could happen if the servers were compromised.</p>\n<p>One idea that was brought forth is to digitally sign WordPress core, theme, and plugin updates. For at least five years, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25052\">a trac ticket</a> has laid semi-dormant with this idea in mind.</p>\n<p>Fifteen months ago, Scott Arciszewski, Chief Development Officer for Paragon Initiative Enterprises, who is most widely known for his <a href=\"https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/02/cryptographically-secure-php-development\">cryptography engineering work</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170214062414/https://medium.com/@CiPHPerCoder/stopmullware-on-the-security-of-27-of-the-websites-on-the-internet-298a7e5b6871\">published an article</a> that has since been taken down, expressing his strong desire for Matt Mullenweg to make secure cryptographic signatures a priority. Mullenweg responded to his post with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@photomatt/wordpress-and-update-signing-51501213e1\">one of his own</a> stating that although WordPress update signing is important, it&#8217;s not a high priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will at some point; as said above it’s a good idea — can’t hurt, might help,&#8221; Mullenweg responded when asked if WordPress was ever going to do update signing. &#8220;There are, however, some more important security issues in front of it, that impact millions of sites in the real world, so we are prioritizing those issues above a nice-to-have, defense in-depth effort.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Eric Mann Launches Secure WordPress Updates Plugin</h2>\n<p>While WordPress does not digitally sign updates, Eric Mann, founder of <a href=\"https://displace.tech/\">Displace Technologies, LLC</a>, has <a href=\"https://ttmm.io/tech/introducing-secure-updates-for-wordpress/\">created and released</a> a new plugin that adds code signing to WordPress core updates. It&#8217;s called DGXPCO or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/dgxpco/\">Digital Guarantees for eXplicitly Permitted Core Operations</a>. You&#8217;ll find it on the plugin directory by searching for DGXPCO.</p>\n<p>When installed and activated, the plugin integrates with the core updater and requires that any core update must have a valid signature before it can be installed. The signature provides a secondary source of truth that confirms the integrity of the files. The signatures are created using a Ed25519 public/private keypair and <a href=\"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium\">Libsodium</a> to sign the files’ contents.</p>\n<p>Mann keeps the private key offline and has published the public key online. The public key will not change and if a core update is signed by a different key, it is a red flag and the update should be avoided. In addition, commits made to the <a href=\"https://github.com/DisplaceTech/release-hashes\">release hashes repository</a> on GitHub are signed with <a href=\"https://keybase.io/eamann\">Mann&#8217;s PGP key</a> to verify that he is the one who added new code.</p>\n<p>Mann admits that the solution is not fool-proof and is working towards improving it. In future versions, the plugin will only notify the user of a WordPress core update if a digital signature is available. Plugins and themes are on the roadmap as well with the ability to opt-in.</p>\n<p>Although he is the only person allowed to digitally sign packages, the model is not sustainable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I prove out the update system, I’ll also begin adding sets of public keys that are scoped to specific sets of packages,&#8221; Mann said. &#8220;This will, for example, allow me to whitelist a small number of trusted developers to also sign core packages. It might also empower plugin developers to sign their own releases (but not anyone else’s).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mann is seeking feedback and is hoping the project provides evidence that something like it can be added to WordPress core.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Mar 2018 00:56:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Post Status: Marketing and positioning WordPress products — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=44157\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://poststatus.com/marketing-positioning-wordpress-products-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2776:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Without it, users will experience unnecessary frustration and hamper enthusiasm of the new editor. In an effort to figure out what plugins are already compatible with Gutenberg, Daniel Bachhuber <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/01/introducing-the-gutenberg-plugin-compatibility-database/\">has created</a> a <a href=\"https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/\">Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database</a>.</p>\n<img />Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database\n<p>The database contains 5,000 plugins that represent more than 90% of the total active install count. Plugins are compatible with Gutenberg if they meet the following two requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A WordPress user can perform the same functional task with Gutenberg active. For instance, if the plugin includes an &#8216;Add Media&#8217; button, it&#8217;s considered Gutenberg-compatible when it has a block registered for the Gutenberg inserter.</li>\n<li>There are no (obvious) errors when the WordPress plugin is active alongside Gutenberg.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to participate in the testing process, you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/#account-details/\">register an account</a> on the site. Once approved, testers will be able to create a fresh sandboxed WordPress install on the site and test randomly selected plugins. After a manual review is complete, plugins will be marked as <code>is_compatible=yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=no</code>.</p>\n<p>Some plugins are already classified with <code>is_compatible=likely_yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=likely_</code>. As reports are completed, two pie charts that display compatibility results at the bottom of the site update automatically.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber estimates that if each plugin takes about a minute to test, they&#8217;ll need roughly 75 person-hours to get through the remaining 4,500 plugins in the database. This project is a great opportunity for individuals and businesses to contribute back to WordPress via the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/\">Five for The Future initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>Ideal testers are those who can review dozens of plugins, but even reviewing a few will help the project.

There have been a lot of interesting new developments, so read on to see what the community has been up to for the past month.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>WordPress 4.9.3 &amp; 4.9.4</h2>\n\n<p>Early in the month, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-3-maintenance-release/\">version 4.9.3 of WordPress was released</a>, including a number of important bug fixes. Unfortunately it introduced a bug that prevented many sites from automatically updating to future releases. To remedy this issue, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/\">version 4.9.4 was released</a> the following day requiring many people to manually update their sites.</p>\n\n<p>While this kind of issue is always regrettable, the good thing is that it was fixed quickly, and that not all sites had updated to 4.9.3 yet, which meant they bypassed the bug in that version.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more technical information about this issue <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/\">on the Core development blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator is Back</h2>\n\n<p>In 2016, the Global Community Team ran an experimental program to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event. This program was dubbed the WordCamp Incubator, and it was so successful in the three cities where it ran that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/\">the program is back for 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Community Team is looking for cities to be a part of this year’s incubator by <a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application\">taking applications</a>. Additionally, each incubator community will need an experienced WordCamp organizer to assist them as a co-lead organizer for their event — if that sounds interesting to you, then you can <a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-co-lead-application\">fill in the application form for co-leads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out further information about the WordCamp Incubator <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/19/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-announcement/\">on the Community Team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Meetup Roundtables scheduled for March</h2>\n\n<p>In order to assist local WordPress meetup organizers with running their meetup groups, some members of the Community Team have organized <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/23/wordpress-meetup-roundtables-scheduled-for-march/\">weekly meetup roundtable discussions through the month of March</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These will be run as video chats at 16:00 UTC every Wednesday this month and will be a great place for meetup organizers to come together and help each other out with practical ideas and advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not already in the WordPress meetup program and would like to join, you can find out more information in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the WordPress Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core</h2>\n\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an upcoming regulation that will affect all online services across Europe. In order to prepare for this, a working group has been formed to make sure that WordPress is compliant with the GDPR regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that this will be a requirement for the project going forward, it will also have an important and significant impact on the privacy and security of WordPress as a whole. The working group has posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/\">their proposed roadmap</a> for this project and it looks very promising.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>WPShout published <a href=\"https://wpshout.com/complete-guide-wordpress-security/\">a thorough guide to WordPress security</a>.</li>\n    <li>The Community Team has published interesting statistics from the WordCamp program in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/27/wordcamps-in-2016/\">2016</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/28/wordcamps-in-2017/\">2017</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/15/potential-addition-of-a-new-onboarding-team/\">An intriguing proposal has been made</a> for a new ‘Onboarding’ team to be started in the WordPress project.</li>\n    <li>The new editing experience for WordPress, named Gutenberg, continues to be actively developed with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16th-february/\">a feature-packed release</a> this past month.</li>\n    <li>The Advanced WordPress Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vS_jR5-nIo\">held an interview with WordPress co-founder, Matt Mullenweg</a> about the Gutenberg project.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2018/02/27/two-factor-authentication-on-wp-org/\">Two factor authentication is on its way to the WordPress.org network</a> — this will be a great improvement to the overall security of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Mar 2018 08:41:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 306 – AMP, GDPR, and Brewing Beer At The Boss’ House\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=78185&preview=true&preview_id=78185\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-306-amp-gdpr-and-brewing-beer-at-the-boss-house\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1707:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> joins me live from Hutchinson, KS, to talk about the news of the week.

We came up with some changes that feel deeply satisfying. Changes we think should help HeroPress, help readers, and help us as content producers. So here we go.</p>\n<h3>Financial Changes</h3>\n<p>At various times in the past people have told me that the time I spend on HeroPress is worth compensation. When I first started it as a blog, I had no intention of getting money from it. However, being compensated for my time helped ease the burden on my family.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With that in mind, last fall I test-drove a donation page based on interest from some in the community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a good idea, and I’m thankful for the support I received, but for now it’s not the right path.</p>\n<p>So, I’ve pulled the donation page from the site and am no longer accepting site sponsors. You’ll notice I do have a Sponsorship page, but it lists organizations that have made material contributions like hosting, plugins, etc.</p>\n<h3>Content Changes</h3>\n<p>We’ve been publishing every Wednesday for several years now. Over time, readership has climbed quite a bit. That’s great, but it means that many current readers have never seen the earlier content, which remains quite evergreen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To address this, we’re going to do new HeroPress essays once a month. The other weeks of the month will be replays of earlier essays.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This allows for some breathing room in gathering new contributors and brings back some really great content that shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>It also opens up my time to explore the community more. To see if there are new ways that people, particularly on the fringe, can be helped. Sharing stories is useful, but are there other opportunities and needs we’re missing?</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>So HeroPress will continue. I still love doing it. At various times we’ve discussed making it bigger, doing grand things. But not now. For now we’re going to let it grow organically and continue letting it serve its purpose: to give voice to WordPress stories, to make them known, to inspire.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Changes Coming To HeroPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Changes%20Coming%20To%20HeroPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Changes Coming To HeroPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F&title=Changes+Coming+To+HeroPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Changes Coming To HeroPress\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/plugins/rtsocial/images/default-pinterest.png&description=Changes Coming To HeroPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Changes Coming To HeroPress\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/\" title=\"Changes Coming To HeroPress\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/\">Changes Coming To HeroPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:00:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: New Team Forms to Facilitate GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78149\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/new-team-forms-to-facilitate-gdpr-compliance-in-wordpress-core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6200:\"<p>As May 25th, the enforcement date for the <a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org/\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) draws near, individuals and businesses are scrambling to make sure they&#8217;re compliant. I&#8217;ve read a number of blog posts throughout the WordPress community explaining the GDPR and what needs to be done for compliance and it&#8217;s a tough thing to grasp.</p>\n<p>The EU GDPR was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, protect and empower European citizens data privacy, and reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. In reading the regulation and various blog posts, the terminology makes it appear that the changes are geared towards large, international businesses that process personal data.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/gdpr-for-web-developers/\">according to Heather Burns</a>, a digital law specialist in Glasgow, Scotland, the GDPR affects sites large and small.</p>\n<blockquote><p>GDPR applies to all businesses, organizations, sectors, situations, and scenarios, regardless of a business’s size, head count, or financial turnover. A small app studio is every bit as beholden to these rules as a large corporation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Determining if your site needs to be compliant and how to accomplish it can be overwhelming. If you do business in Europe or collect data from European users, you must protect that data in accordance with the GDPR as if you were in Europe. For example, if you operate a blog with a contact form that saves entries to the database from people who live in Europe, you must make your site GDPR compliant.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of aspects to the GDPR and while an excerpt can not fully explain it at a glance, there are a few themes that stick out to me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be upfront and concise about what data is stored, sent, and used on the site or form.</li>\n<li>Give the user a chance to consent without automatically opting them in.</li>\n<li>Collect the least amount of data possible for legitimate business purposes.</li>\n<li>Provide a way for users to download or access their data and remove it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these are common sense practices that are not implemented on many sites, WP Tavern included. How often do you visit a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/contact-me\">site&#8217;s contact form</a> and see an explanation as to why those fields are required, where the data is stored, where it goes, and what is done with it? This is something I&#8217;ll be working on in the next few weeks.</p>\n<h2>Making WordPress Core GDPR Compliant</h2>\n<p>Earlier <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/13/gdpr-compliance-agenda-february-14/\">this month</a>, a number of volunteers gathered to discuss GDPR compliance in WordPress core. The meeting took place in a newly created channel #gdpr-compliance that&#8217;s accessible to anyone with a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">SlackHQ account</a>.</p>\n<p>The team created a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/\">proposed roadmap</a> to add privacy tools to core. The plan includes the following ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add notices for registered users and commenters on what data is collected in core by default and explain why.</li>\n<li>Create guidelines for plugins on how to become GDPR compliant.</li>\n<li>Create and add tools to facilitate compliance and privacy in general.</li>\n<li>Add documentation and help for site owners to learn how to use these tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C9695RJBW/p1519227959000760\">Earlier today</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/27/gdpr-compliance-chat-recap-february-21st/\">the team met</a> and created a <a href=\"https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info\">GitHub folder</a> that houses the roadmap, knowledge base, trac ticket list, and other items associated with the project. There was also some discussion on whether the interface provided by the <a href=\"https://www.gdprwp.com/\">GDPR for WordPress project</a> is a good foundation for core and plugins to report personal data. The GDPR Compliance Slack channel is also a good place to ask questions and discuss data privacy in general.</p>\n<p>Popular form plugins such as <a href=\"https://docs.gravityforms.com/wordpress-gravity-forms-and-gdpr-compliance/\">GravityForms</a> and <a href=\"https://ninjaforms.com/gdpr-compliance-wordpress-forms/\">NinjaForms</a> have documentation available that explains GDPR compliance and how it applies to their products. For those who use the Contact Form module in Jetpack which <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/8430\">saves entries to the database by default</a>, you&#8217;ll need to wait for further updates. <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/12/gdpr-compliance-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce</a> and <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/automattic-gdpr/\">Automattic</a> have announced that they expect their products will be GDPR compliant by the time it goes into effect later this year.</p>\n<h2>GDPR Resources</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like me, reading about the GDPR and its policies can make your head spin. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that at the heart of the GDPR are common sense behaviors for handling personal data.

The interview concludes the <a href=\"http://www.advancedwp.org/awp-gutenberg-interview-series/\">Advanced WordPress Gutenberg interview series</a> that includes, <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/06/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-joost-de-valk/\">Joost de Valk</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/18/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-ahmad-awais/\">Ahmad Awais</a>, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ic_du_lsbLE\">Tammie Lister</a>.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg began the session by explaining why there is a concerted effort to improve the editor. &#8220;It&#8217;s really almost any user test that you watch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both watching people brand new to WordPress and those with years of experience on how they used the editor. It became obvious that we could make something more accessible to new users, but also, a lot more powerful for developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With regards to a release date, Mullenweg confirmed that Gutenberg will ship when it&#8217;s ready. Later in the interview, Mullenweg was asked if he could provide a more concrete answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For those who want a concrete date, we will have one or two orders of magnitude more users of Gutenberg in April,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily a 5.0 release, but it does mean that if you&#8217;re planning on aiming for something where a lot of users will be interacting with Gutenberg, aim for April.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the project&#8217;s name is Gutenberg, some developers have <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4681\">expressed concerns</a> on how the name will be deprecated if at all once it&#8217;s merged into core. There are a number of educational resources, products, and tool kits referencing Gutenberg that could be a source of confusion once it&#8217;s merged into core and referred to as the editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg was asked if the Gutenberg name will be deprecated. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the most important thing to figure out right now. We&#8217;re tackling some much bigger issues. If the plugin is useful, we&#8217;ll keep it around for beta testing, if not, we&#8217;ll have it turn itself off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg concluded the interview thanking the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/\">Advanced WordPress Facebook</a> group for the passion and discussions shared by members. The group has more than 30K members, is free to join, well maintained, and often filled with interesting topics.

In more plain terms, it’s a law designed to increase data privacy for EU citizens.</p>\n<h2>Why GDPR Matters</h2>\n<p>This privacy regulation extends beyond EU-based companies; if your website collects personally-identifiable data from EU citizens, your website needs to be compliant with GDPR. This includes data that is collected through contact form entries, user registrations, eCommerce sales, and even blog post comments, to name a few.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot more to it, so we encourage you to do your own research to see how GDPR may affect your site. These resources can help get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/smedataprotect/index_en.htm\">Data protection infographic</a> (European Commission)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/complete-wordpress-gdpr-guide/\">WordPress GDPR Guide</a> (CodeinWP)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gdprwp.com/\">GDPR for WordPress</a> (a validation framework project)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/automattic-gdpr/\">Automattic’s post</a> on GDPR compliance</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What We’re Working On</h2>\n<p>Modern Tribe has always been diligent about information privacy. We regularly conduct security audits for our plugins, as well as security audits of our website to help ensure customer data is securely processed by our servers.</p>\n<p>For us, security and privacy are priorities that we routinely evaluate and revisit to ensure we&#8217;re providing the best service we can for our customers. Here are some specific efforts we’ve been working on in light of GDPR:</p>\n<h3>Data Collection and Privacy</h3>\n<p>Our existing <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/privacy-policy/\">privacy policy</a> has been reviewed so we can identify updates that need to be made. We already include disclosures for information collection and use, log data, cookies, and behavioral remarketing. We also include disclosures relevant to our plugins that outline our data collection and use for both default and opt-in information. There are several other sections within our privacy policy that we’re revisiting in the interest of being transparent with our users.</p>\n<p>For our free plugins available in the WordPress.org repository, we are working on adding a privacy policy and data collection statement that is accessible to users without requiring them to visit our website.</p>\n<h3>Compliance Assistance for Site Owners</h3>\n<p>We’re working on an additional policy statement on data collection that site owners can add to their own privacy policy that informs their end users of any data being collected by our plugins.</p>\n<p>Since site owners are responsible for sharing this information with their users, our goal is to make it as easy as possible for them to maintain their site’s compliance when running our plugins.</p>\n<h3>Improved Email Opt-in Choices</h3>\n<p>Although we primarily use our monthly newsletter as a platform to inform users of news and helpful information related to our plugins, and readers always have the option to unsubscribe, we will be adjusting our signup process to increase the control over the types of emails a user wishes to receive.</p>\n<h2>An Ongoing Effort</h2>\n<p>The efforts we’re putting into GDPR compliance—and user privacy in general—are too long to list in this blog post. Our team understands the importance of this issue to our users, and we&#8217;ll continue to work hard and earn your trust and your business.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/our-approach-to-gdpr/\">Our Approach to GDPR</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com\">The Events Calendar</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"SVN Bot: Releasing New Versions of Plugins from Slack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/svn-bot-releasing-new-versions-plugins-slack/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Technology\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/?p=1490160\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:679:\"<p>We actively maintain five free plugins on WordPress.org, and with maintenance releases shipping every three weeks, that means we frequently find ourselves deploying updates via Subversion (&#8220;SVN&#8221;), the version control platform used by WordPress.org.

Enter: SVN Bot. With this tool we can now tag and release new versions of our plugins from the comfort of Slack!</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Letting a Bot Do All the Hard Work</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The deployment process occurs in a remote server—no need to have a copy of our SVN repositories in a local computer</li>\n<li>If something goes wrong (we accidentally tag the wrong version number, for example, or the bot finds that some plugin files are corrupted), we can revert the <em>entire</em> process and start over again with a single command</li>\n<li>Anyone on the team can now release new versions of plugins</li>\n<li>The entire team can monitor the deployment status via Slack</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Anatomy of the Bot</h2>\n<p>SVN Bot was developed with <a href=\"https://botman.io/2.0/botman-studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Botman Studio</a>, an open source PHP chatbot bundled with Laravel, a popular application framework. The bot listens for a specific command on Slack, then sends the user’s input to <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jenkins</a>.</p>\n<p>Jenkins is a server-based system that does a lot of the actual &#8220;work&#8221; of SVN Bot: it builds and executes bash scripts that release new versions of our plugins, revert the entire deployment process, or simply check the deployment status.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1490166\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"879\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20.png 879w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-140x43.png 140w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-300x91.png 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-768x234.png 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-665x203.png 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-430x131.png 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-645x197.png 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-460x140.png 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-600x183.png 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-from-2018-03-27-20-40-20-500x152.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px\" /></p>\n<h2>SVN Bot in Action</h2>\n<p>Now let’s see how the bot works!

Selling more of your event tickets means more money in your pocket, and more customers interacting with your brand in real life. If you’re looking for the easy way to increase your ticket sales, we’ve got a few quick tips for you.</p>\n<h2>1. Make your event easy to find</h2>\n<p>Some people already know what they want. If you’re offering it, make sure they can find what they’re looking for quickly and easily. Add our <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-filterbar/\">Filter Bar</a> add-on to your site so users can quickly navigate to the types of events they’re looking for.</p>\n<p>Nothing is worse than losing out on ticket sales because someone couldn’t find the right event!</p>\n<h2>2. Offer multiple times</h2>\n<p>If you’ve already got the resources and you can spare the time, why not offer the same event, again? This is a great way to increase your ticket sales, because you’ll capture any sales you originally lost to scheduling conflicts. Plus, hosting one event multiple times can have benefits for you as well—as they say, practice makes perfect!</p>\n<h2>3. Have an engaging event page</h2>\n<p>Make your <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/anatomy-of-an-awesome-event-page/\">event page awesome</a>. This is your opportunity to really sell your event tickets. Write an event description that’s compelling and tells readers why they should attend. Use a featured image that portrays the vibe of the event well, and connects to your audience on an emotional level.</p>\n<h2>4. Have tickets ready</h2>\n<p>Your event description did the trick and you’ve got your audience eager to attend. Now what? Make sure your <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets/\">ticket sale</a> is present right on your event page! Don’t lose any interested readers in site navigation. Make it easy to buy your event ticket.</p>\n<h2>5. Keep the registration short</h2>\n<p>Even the most enthusiastic attendee doesn’t want to fill out 15 fields of information to attend an event. Be critical of your <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/collecting-attendee-information/\">registration form</a>. Do you <em>really</em> need to know every piece of information you&#8217;re asking for? And even for essential fields, looks for ways to optimize—for example, why have a separate &#8220;first name&#8221; and &#8220;last name&#8221; field instead of just one &#8220;full name&#8221; field?</p>\n<p><strong>Remember: if your event ticket sales process is easy, more people will complete it.</strong></p>\n<h2>6. Add a little something extra</h2>\n<p>A great way to increase ticket sales is to include a little gift or added value for your attendee. Do you have something you could offer to sweeten the deal? A small item like a free water bottle or free access to your online course will be just the thing to convince the customers who are still unsure.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the ways to increase ticket sales without much effort. Most of these ideas are simple tweaks you can make to your website in a few minutes, if you’ve got the right <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/products/804/\">tools.</a> Make sure both your site and your events are optimized, so you can sell as many event tickets as possible!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/quick-tips-sell-more-event-tickets/\">6 Quick Tips to Sell More Event Tickets</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com\">The Events Calendar</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Design Tips to Help You Brand Your Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/design-tips-brand-your-events/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 16:54:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:11:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Articles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"brand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"branding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"color\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"colors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"font\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:9;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"fonts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:10;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"images\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/?p=1491992\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:582:\"<p>A strong brand reinforces who you are, and often dictates how you&#8217;re perceived.

Colors chosen in these sections will override the general theme for those pages. We strongly recommend you use the same color scheme on all of your event pages.</p>\n<p>Customizing your colors is the first step in making your events calendar feel like your very own.</p>\n<h2>Typography</h2>\n<p>Fonts are another feature of your event pages that have the power to strongly portray your brand. Fonts can be serious and factual, formal and elegant, or even simple and relaxed.</p>\n<p><strong>By default, The Events Calendar uses the fonts dictated by your active theme.</strong> But with so many free, commercial, and custom-built themes out there, we can’t guarantee the fonts will <em>always</em> be correctly sized and styled to your brand’s specifications. That’s why we’ve provided a Knowledgebase article to guide you on implementing custom CSS for your events calendar, which can be useful for correcting any issues with how your site&#8217;s fonts are displaying on the events calendar. You can find that article <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/changing-fonts-and-colours/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Content</h2>\n<p>The copy on each of your event pages is a great opportunity to convey the tone and voice of your brand. By reading what you have to say—and how you say it—people get a feeling for the personality of your brand.</p>\n<p>If your brand is elegant and sophisticated, you should use formal language and meticulously ensure your grammar and vocabulary are choices are on-point. If your brand is simple and fun, using more casual language and throwing in a joke or two is a great way to build a connection with your audience on a more personal level.</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate any written content—the tone and voice of your brand can impact every last detail of your site. For example, let&#8217;s say you were listing some key details about an event on your event, like when it&#8217;s starting and its venue. You <em>could</em> simply preface these pieces of information with &#8220;When:&#8221; and &#8220;Where:&#8221;. But maybe it&#8217;ll feel more natural for your brand to use &#8220;Arrival:&#8221; and &#8220;Venue:&#8221; instead (if it&#8217;s a bit more formal), or &#8220;The Place:&#8221; and &#8220;The Time:&#8221; (if it&#8217;s a bit more casual).</p>\n<p><strong>All of these word choices matter</strong> when it comes to writing in your brand&#8217;s voice. For a deeper dive on this—including how to <em>find</em> your brand&#8217;s voice—check out <a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/tone-of-voice/\">this article by Harriet Cummings</a>.</p>\n<h2>Process</h2>\n<p>Being mindful of the functionality in your event navigation and/or registration process is a fun way to ramp up your branding.</p>\n<p>For example, if your brand has a heavy international focus, guests might love Events Calendar PRO&#8217;s Map View so they can see the events you are hosting across the world (check out a live demo of the Map View <a href=\"https://wpshindig.com/events/map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Even if you’re not adding features, it’s important to walk through the process your user will take and make sure each step is cohesive with your brand. If you’ve portrayed &#8220;simplicity&#8221; throughout your site in your branding, you might want to reconsider an exceptionally long, detailed registration form. As another example, if your brand is family-friendly, have you acknowledged what role kids will play (if any) in your event descriptions?</p>\n<p>Small things like this are a great way to take your branding one step further, and make you stand out amongst the crowd.</p>\n<h2>Images</h2>\n<p>When it comes to branding, images are your best friend. Images have the ability to convey the feeling or vibe of your brand much more accurately than words ever could. Adjectives you might use to describe your brand will be much more easily understandable through images than they would be through words.</p>\n<p><strong>Each of your events should include a featured image.</strong> For the best results, decide on a theme for your images, whether it be color scheme, feeling, subject, or all of the above. This way, when readers are browsing through your calendar, they’ll see one unified brand portrayed across all your events.</p>\n<p>You can even bring your branding to the PDF tickets your attendees receive upon registration <em>(If you don’t have the free PDF tickets extension yet, download it <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/extensions/pdf-tickets/\">here</a>).</em> You can add a featured image to your PDF ticket by clicking on &#8220;Settings&#8221; in the <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets/\">Event Tickets</a> section of your event and selecting a &#8220;Ticket Header Image&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Include images whenever possible on your event pages. An event page without an image is a lost opportunity to make an emotional connection to your audience!</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Whatever features you use, colors you pick , and word choices you make on your event pages, <strong>the most important thing to remember is to be cohesive</strong>. Go through the process and make sure your branding is <strong>consistent</strong> in all of these features, on every page. Don’t make the mistake of going in one direction with your images, and a totally different one with the tone and voice of your written content.</p>\n<p>Portraying a solid brand throughout each element of your site will leave visitors with a strong and lasting impression of who you are.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/design-tips-brand-your-events/\">Design Tips to Help You Brand Your Events</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com\">The Events Calendar</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"Maintenance Release for the Week of 25 March 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/maintenance-release-week-25-march-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 18:27:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Release Notes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/?p=1490583\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:619:\"<p>Welcome to the fifth maintenance release of 2018!

You’ve spent hours designing a stunning site that’s unique and true to your brand, and now you need your event pages to match.</p>\n<p>With a few key features and best practices in mind, you can give your event page the power to convince your users to attend your events, and ensure they have the information they need to have a good time.</p>\n<p>Below is everything you’ll need to make your event page stand out from the crowd.</p>\n<h2>1. A Killer Event Description</h2>\n<p>The best event pages we’ve seen go above and beyond with their event descriptions. Think about everything you’d tell your audience about your event if you were speaking to them in person. Including details like the purpose of the event, the backgrounds of your speakers, or the history of your venue are sure to wow your users and create a lasting impression.</p>\n<p>As a best practice, we recommend framing the event description as a value proposition. <strong>Don’t just focus on the <em>what</em> of the event. Focus on <em>why</em> they should care.</strong> What will they get out of attending the event?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/event/2017-directors-consortium/\">Stanford Law’</a>s calendar is a perfect example of event descriptions done right. They include all the information that anyone interested in the event would need to know, from application deadlines to related courses. They also make it very clear who should attend and why, with value proposition sections like “key benefits” and “who should attend”.</p>\n<p>Finally, they’ve included a simple summary of all the critical information near the bottom of the page. This is great for people who have already read the description, and are re-visiting the page to ensure they have the right start time and address. Well done, Stanford Law!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 988px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'video\');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1486818-1\" width=\"988\" height=\"720\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/stanford-walkthru-vid.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/stanford-walkthru-vid.mp4\">http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/stanford-walkthru-vid.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>2. A Visual User Experience</h2>\n<p>Humans are visual creatures. Most of us love a site with great icons or creative buttons that convey clear information without the use of words.</p>\n<p>For example, check out the “+” and “-” buttons surrounding the “People” fields in the ticket forms along the side of <a href=\"https://www.erlebniskochen.de/event/genuss-auf-tour-2018/2018-08-18/\">Erlebniskochen’s</a> website. No doubt you know what to do when you see those buttons. The purpose is clear, and the design is kept clean and minimal. These buttons do the same job as instructional text, without the bulk.</p>\n<p>Something else we love about this event page is the awesome detail they’ve included in their event description. Under the booking section they’ve included a menu of the food that will be served at the events. They’ve also included a gallery of photos for each event as opposed to the standard, single image. As mentioned above, these kinds of details paint a picture for your guest and could be the factor that persuades them to attend.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1489085\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2.jpg\" alt=\"erlebnis\" width=\"1230\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2.jpg 1230w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-116x85.jpg 116w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-300x219.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-768x561.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-665x486.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-430x314.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-645x471.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-1068x780.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-460x336.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-600x438.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/erlebnis-2-500x365.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px\" /></p>\n<h2>3. Branding</h2>\n<p>The best sites use branding to give users a certain feeling while they’re engaging with the content. It’s important to make sure your brand stays consistent across your event pages. Using a simple, unembellished event listing in a bright, bubbly webpage is sure to stand out—but not in a good way!</p>\n<p>A great event page doesn’t need to include intense customization; it’s often just a matter of finding the right theme and tweaking a few colours, fonts, and curated images to make your event listing well-suited to the rest of your site.</p>\n<p>Check out this simple but effective use of branding by <a href=\"https://www.cotswoldelectricbiketours.co.uk/tour/kingham/?selected=true&amp;start_date=30th%20March%202018&amp;cost=75&amp;stock=8&amp;id=2376\">Cotswold Electric Bike Tours</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1488428\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold.jpg\" alt=\"cotswold\" width=\"1230\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold.jpg 1230w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-116x85.jpg 116w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-300x219.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-768x561.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-665x486.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-430x314.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-645x471.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-1068x780.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-460x336.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-600x438.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/cotswold-500x365.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px\" /></p>\n<h2>4. Images</h2>\n<p>As the old saying goes, a picture is worth 1,000 words. In reality, a picture is more likely worth 60,000 words as the human brain processes images a whopping 60,000x faster than text!</p>\n<p>Including a big, clear image on your event page is a great way to inspire an emotional reaction to your event, which can be a powerful promotional tool. Images have the power to convey the feeling or “vibe” your event might have much more effectively than words.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artcenter.org/event/cesar-millan/\">Art Center</a> was really creative in their use of images, customizing their event page so a large, clear event image is the first thing you see with the key event details neatly beneath.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1488425\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info.jpg\" alt=\"art-center\" width=\"1230\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info.jpg 1230w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-116x85.jpg 116w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-300x219.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-768x561.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-665x486.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-430x314.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-645x471.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-1068x780.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-460x336.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-600x438.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/art-info-500x365.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px\" /></p>\n<h2>5. A Clear and Well-Placed Call to Action</h2>\n<p>Another great thing about the Art Center event page is one clear call to action. Their mission isn’t diluted with multiple buttons or actions for the user to take.</p>\n<p>Keeping your call to action simple is a very effective way to encourage users to take that next step because you’ve eliminated the risk of them getting lost or distracted along the way.</p>\n<p>If you’re selling tickets to your event, we recommend including the ticketing section right on your events page, as that’s where they’re most interested and excited about your event. Providing a call to action at the right time can be the difference between selling a ticket or not.</p>\n<p>If you’re using the free version of <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets/\">Event Tickets</a>, you can now sell tickets using our simple <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/complete-free-ticket-sales-solution/\">PayPal integration</a>. For more complicated ticket sales, we recommend <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets-plus/\">Event Tickets Plus</a>, which will allow you to integrate our ticket-selling software with a more powerful ecommerce platform like WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads.</p>\n<p>Both plugins allow you to set the location of your tickets form on the event page to best suit your needs.</p>\n<h2>6. Social Sharing Buttons</h2>\n<p>The best kind of promotion is referral marketing. There is no greater way to establish trust with a potential customer than a recommendation from someone they are close to.</p>\n<p>If your event description gets someone excited enough to share it with their friends, make it easy for them to share by including social share buttons directly on your event page, like this example from <a href=\"https://www.wardleacademy.co.uk/event/football-fixture-cardinal-langley-high-school-year-9/\">Wardle Academy</a>. For a few options to include social share buttons, check out this <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/adding-social-media-sharing-to-events/\">knowledgebase article</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1488429\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle.jpg\" alt=\"wardle\" width=\"1230\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle.jpg 1230w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-116x85.jpg 116w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-300x219.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-768x561.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-665x486.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-430x314.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-645x471.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-1068x780.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-460x336.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-600x438.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/wardle-500x365.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px\" /></p>\n<h2>7. Other Events</h2>\n<p>Finally, a great events page gives a shout-out to your other events. If your user gets to your event page and decides not to attend, all hope is not lost! They might be interested in another event you’re hosting.</p>\n<p>Having a quick gateway to other events can keep a user browsing and prevent them from leaving your site. A simple redirection could even result in additional ticket sales!</p>\n<p>Check out how <a href=\"https://www.veganeventhub.com/events/\">Vegan Event Hub</a> added an “upcoming events” feature down the right side by adding the Upcoming Events widget.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1488430\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan.jpg\" alt=\"vegan\" width=\"1230\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan.jpg 1230w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-116x85.jpg 116w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-300x219.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-768x561.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-665x486.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-430x314.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-645x471.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-1068x780.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-460x336.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-600x438.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/vegan-500x365.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Power of an Awesome Event Page</h2>\n<p>A great event page has the ability to turn visitors of your site into attendees of your events. It should also give them the information they need to make sure they have a good experience.</p>\n<p>Giving your attendees a real-life positive interaction with your brand is a very powerful thing! When attendees enjoy your events, they’re likely to attend more of your events in the future—and possibly bring their network with them.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/anatomy-of-an-awesome-event-page/\">Anatomy of an Awesome Event Page</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com\">The Events Calendar</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"The Mascots of The Events Calendar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/mascots-events-calendar/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 16:36:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Lifestream\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"mascots\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"modern tribe\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"team culture\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"The Events Calendar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/?p=1478774\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:583:\"<p>Have you ever noticed the friendly creatures that accompany each feature release?

It just so happened that he and our Director of Product, Zach, lived in the same town.</p>\n<p>They decided to make the most of it and rent a small office space so they could work together. Matt created a sign for the front door, featuring a narwhal (and <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar/\">The Events Calendar</a>, of course).</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1478782 size-full\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal.jpg\" alt=\"TEC narwhal\" width=\"1944\" height=\"1419\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal.jpg 1944w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-116x85.jpg 116w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-300x219.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-768x561.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-665x485.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-430x314.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-645x471.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-1068x780.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-460x336.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-600x438.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-narwhal-500x365.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1944px) 100vw, 1944px\" /></p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that our team adored this lovable narwhal. Soon after his introduction, we were featuring him on t-shirts and other swag.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, version 3.10 of The Events Calendar was about to release, and we wanted to include our beloved narwhal in the announcement. When version 3.11 was ready to roll out, it was clear to everyone that we had no intentions of going back to our old, critter-less feature releases. A new tradition was born!</p>\n<h2>Introducing: The Mascots of The Events Calendar!</h2>\n<p>As this new tradition was forming, Matt randomly drew whichever animal he wanted—often an animal he’d never had the chance to draw before.</p>\n\n<a href=\'https://theeventscalendar.com/mascots-events-calendar/tec_jerboa/\'><img width=\"300\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-300x197.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"TEC_jerboa\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-300x197.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-129x85.jpg 129w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-768x505.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-665x437.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-430x283.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-645x424.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-1068x702.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-460x302.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-600x394.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa-500x329.jpg 500w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC_jerboa.jpg 1103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>\n<a href=\'https://theeventscalendar.com/mascots-events-calendar/tec-cassowary/\'><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-300x169.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-140x79.jpg 140w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-768x432.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-665x374.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-430x242.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-645x363.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-460x259.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-600x338.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary-500x281.jpg 500w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-cassowary.jpg 1191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>\n<a href=\'https://theeventscalendar.com/mascots-events-calendar/tec-orangutan/\'><img width=\"245\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-245x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-245x300.jpg 245w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-69x85.jpg 69w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-768x941.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-665x815.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan.jpg 807w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-430x527.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-645x790.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-460x564.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-300x368.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-600x735.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-orangutan-500x613.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" /></a>\n\n<p>As time went on, however, we started to view our mascots as an opportunity to reflect our team, and strengthen our unique culture.</p>\n<h2>Extensions of Our Culture</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that we at Modern Tribe value a rich relationship between work and life. This is evident not only in our Slack&#8217;s #watercooler channel—the hub for our team to hangout and chat—but in <em>every</em> Slack channel.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s critical, in a remote setting, to allow conversations to ebb and flow naturally from personal to professional if you’re going to feel a connection with the people you work with. Over time, we’ve seen running jokes born, funny stories divulged, strange talents discovered, and real, strong friendships formed.</p>\n<p>Instead of keeping our personal connections separate from our work, we choose to integrate the two in an effort to encourage and celebrate the online environment that keeps our workdays fun, and our team bond strong.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1478797 size-full\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda.jpg\" alt=\"TEC - panda\" width=\"1191\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda.jpg 1191w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-140x79.jpg 140w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-300x169.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-768x432.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-665x374.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-430x242.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-645x363.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-460x259.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-600x338.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-panda-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px\" /></p>\n<p>The panda mascot was a celebration of someone who was new to the team at the time, Luca.

If you’re a panda-lover looking for a good debate, Luca is the man to talk to.</p>\n<p>Teasing Luca about his panda hatred has kept us entertained throughout many, many workdays.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1478803 size-full\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose.jpg\" alt=\"TEC - goose\" width=\"1191\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose.jpg 1191w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-140x79.jpg 140w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-300x169.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-768x432.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-665x374.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-430x242.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-645x363.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-460x259.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-600x338.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-goose-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px\" /></p>\n<p>Our funny stories with one another aren’t contained in Slack alone.

Sometimes, we choose to celebrate our teammates not by a silly joke, but by something really neat they have going on in their lives.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1478809\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn.jpg\" alt=\"TEC - fawn\" width=\"894\" height=\"894\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn.jpg 894w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-85x85.jpg 85w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-300x300.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-768x768.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-665x665.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-430x430.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-645x645.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-180x180.jpg 180w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-270x270.jpg 270w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-460x460.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-150x150.jpg 150w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-100x100.jpg 100w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-600x600.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-fawn-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px\" /></p>\n<p>As you may have noticed, The Events Calendar fawn is named Dale. Dale is a representation of a real baby fawn who was found near his mother, who had been hit by a car, and rescued by our former team member Brook. Before his return to the wild, Dale often joined in on daily meetings with the Modern Tribe team while he enjoyed his bottle.</p>\n<h2>Connections Beyond the Internet</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our strong commitment to team culture, genuine friendships have flourished. Many times, the conversations we have with each other online get carried into the real world as well.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1478811\" src=\"http://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken.jpg\" alt=\"TEC - chicken\" width=\"1191\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken.jpg 1191w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-140x79.jpg 140w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-300x169.jpg 300w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-768x432.jpg 768w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-665x374.jpg 665w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-430x242.jpg 430w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-645x363.jpg 645w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-460x259.jpg 460w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-600x338.jpg 600w, https://theeventscalendar.com/content/uploads/2018/03/TEC-chicken-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px\" /></p>\n<p>Take for example, our mascot chicken.

The giant squid is the first mascot to ever actually represent our plugins or their features. He accompanied the release of our <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/event-aggregator/\">Event Aggregator</a> service, proudly representing the many platforms from which you could pull events into your calendar with his long, suction-cupped tentacles.</p>\n<h2>It All Comes Back to Matt</h2>\n<p>To this day, all our mascots are illustrated by Matt. He uses a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet and stylus to draw the animals directly into Photoshop, where he can apply his editing magic. He’s illustrated a children&#8217;s book, a number of book covers, and—in his own words —&#8221;a whole pile of nerdy art&#8221;. At Modern Tribe, illustrating the mascots gives him a nice break from his usual code-heavy work.</p>\n<p>We’re grateful to have Matt on our team—and all the quirky mascots he brings with him.</p>\n<h2>Representing Our Team</h2>\n<p>These critters represent the whimsy we bring to our work everyday, and help us show you a bit of who we are with each new feature release. They offer brief glimpses into the conversations that make us love what we do, and the stories and bonds that make us a strong, successful team.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/mascots-events-calendar/\">The Mascots of The Events Calendar</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com\">The Events Calendar</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"A Complete (and FREE) Ticket Sales Solution\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/complete-free-ticket-sales-solution/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 16:04:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:9:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Promotion\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"event ticket plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"event tickets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Event Tickets Plus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"paypal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"ticket\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"ticket sales plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"ticketing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/?p=1460825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:602:\"<p>Event Tickets has everything you need to start selling tickets today!

Start collecting money and RSVPs for your events quickly and easily with just one plugin.</p>\n<p>For paid events, simply enter your desired ticket price, connect your PayPal account to the Event Tickets plugin, and you’re all set!</p>\n<h2>Event Tickets Keeps it Simple</h2>\n<p>Our new Tribe Commerce feature does all the heavy lifting so there’s no extra legwork for you. All you have to do is connect your PayPal account to Event Tickets, and the money from ticket sales will flow directly into your account. You’ll be able to add tickets to events, posts, or pages.</p>\n<p>Upon purchasing, your customers will be automatically taken to the familiar PayPal purchase page to complete their transaction. They&#8217;ll be returned to your page once their purchase is complete, making their overall experience on your site smooth and hassle-free.</p>\n<p>On the back end, you’ll enjoy the simplicity of our clean attendee lists and intuitive interface.</p>\n<h2>Use Event Tickets to Improve Your Planning Process</h2>\n<p>Requiring guests to make a financial commitment to attend your event—even just $5.00—can dramatically reduce the number of no-shows. People won’t pay for an event unless they fully intend to go, giving you a more accurate idea of numbers to help you with your planning.</p>\n<p>Another way to better plan for your audience is to be aware of your demographics. With Event Tickets, you can create multiple ticket types to control the amount of folks showing up from different groups. For example, you may want to know how many attendees are <em>members</em> as opposed to <em>guests</em>, so you can prepare presentations tailored for each group. You may also need to keep track of the children attending to make sure you’ve got enough kid-friendly activities on hand.</p>\n<p>Either way, Event Tickets gives you all the information you’ll need to make an effective plan.</p>\n<h2>Jump-Start Your Re-marketing Campaign</h2>\n<p>Having Events Tickets on your site can also help you to quickly build your email list. How? By requiring your attendees to register for your site before purchasing tickets.</p>\n<p>Requiring users to register cements an avenue for future re-marketing. Turn your one-time attendees into life-long customers, and you&#8217;ll see more dollars in your pockets at future events. You can get in touch with your guests after the event just to say “Thanks for coming!” or to ask follow up questions that will help you plan even better events in the future.</p>\n<h2>Is Event Tickets the Solution for You?</h2>\n<p>To start selling tickets to your events quickly and easily, <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets/\">download Event Tickets</a> to your WordPress site.</p>\n<h2>Need More?</h2>\n<p>If you’re just looking for a no-nonsense ticket sales plugin, Event Tickets is a great solution. If your needs are a little more complex, Event Tickets Plus has additional functionality to offer you more control over your ticket sales.</p>\n<p>Event Tickets Plus integrates with major WordPress e-commerce platforms so you can leverage and incorporate their powerful capabilities into your ticket sales.</p>\n<p>For more advanced ticketing, Event Tickets Plus has shared capacity options so that you can sell different types of tickets from one pool of stock. Say your event venue has a max capacity of 100: simply set the Shared Capacity to 100 and start selling tickets. Whatever combination of ticket types is purchased, you won’t go over the total event capacity.</p>\n<p>There are many more features at your disposal with Event Tickets Plus, including QR codes for your tickets and custom attendee registration.</p>\n<p>Learn more about taking your ticket sales to the next level with <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets-plus/\">Event Tickets Plus</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/complete-free-ticket-sales-solution/\">A Complete (and FREE) Ticket Sales Solution</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com\">The Events Calendar</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"Announcing Events Calendar PRO 4.4.24.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/announcing-events-calendar-pro-4-4-24-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 21:21:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Release Notes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://theeventscalendar.com/?p=1478179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:580:\"<p>Events Calendar PRO 4.4.24.2 is available now and corrects an oversight in our 4.4.24 release which led to a 500 internal server error and database issues which affected a small portions of installs.
